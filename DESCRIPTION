Description: Cast Vote Records (also known as ballot images) are discrete 
 records of a voter's votes on a potentially long ballot. This package provides 
 a clustering algorithm that categorizes complicated voting profiles into 
 prototypical vote profiles. Unlike off the shelf algorithms, this algorithm is
 built for multinomial outcomes with potentially large swaths of missingness. 
 It computes a EM algorithm with a C++ backend (Rcpp) for speed.
