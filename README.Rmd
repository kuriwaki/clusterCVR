`clusterCVR` provides an EM Algorithm for Mixture Models of Votes with Varying Choice Sets. It is a clustering algorithm particularly designed for analyzing mid to high dimensional datasets when voters vote on Republican or Democratic candidates on the long ballot.

### Loading

```{r}
library(clusterCVR)
```


# Derivation

See [**cat-mixture.pdf**](cat-mixture.pdf) for the writeup of the model.  Source is [cat-mixture.tex](cat-mixture.tex)


# Usage

**No varying choice set**

```{r}
data("simdata_full")
out_cl <- clusterCVR(simdata_full, init = "kmeans")

summary(out_cl)
```

We can also check the log likelihood monotonically increasing:
```{r}
pars <- summ_params(out_cl)
graph_trend(pars, simdata_full)
```

<!-- Many finite mixture models exist, but almost all are limited to continuous outcomes via Gaussian mixutre models.  The folowing table comes from the `mclust` package R Journal [vignette](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2016/RJ-2016-021/RJ-2016-021.pdf):  -->

<!-- ```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "70%"} -->

<!-- `mclust` is the most downloaded package, with `Rmixmod` coming in second.  [Rmixmod](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v067i06) is the only package of these that has a interface for analyzing categorical (what they call "qualitative") outcome data. It was recently updated on CRAN (May 2020), and is based on a broader computational library, [MixMod](http://www.mixmod.org/). Here is how it works. -->



```{r, eval = FALSE, include = FALSE}
library(Rmixmod)
data(birds)
head(birds) # data where all variables are factor

out_mm <- mixmodCluster(data = birds, nbCluster = 3)
summary(out_mm)
```
